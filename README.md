# File-preparation-for-Preservica
# This is a Windows Powershell script for preparing files in a .pax folder format for multi-part assets to ingest into Digital Preservation software Preservica
# It includes an extra folder "wrapper" for each .pax folder, to facilitate linking the metadata to each object at a level that can also be interpreted by our public front-end platform.
